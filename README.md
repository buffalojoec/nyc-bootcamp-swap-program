In a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), a common way to manage a liquidity pool is through a Constant-Product Algorithm, which involves programmatically ensuring that the product of all assets equals some constant value `K`.  

Consider a request to swap `p` number of one asset for some unknown number of another asset `r`:
```
K = a * b * c * d * P * R
K = a * b * c * d * (P + p) * (R - r)

a * b * c * d * P * R = a * b * c * d * (P + p) * (R - r)
PR = (P + p) * (R - r)
PR = PR - Pr + Rp - pr
0 = 0 - Pr + Rp - pr
-Rp = -Pr - pr
-Rp = r(-P - p)
r = (-Rp) / (-P - p)
r = [-1 * Rp] / [-1 * (P + p)]
r = Rp / (P + p)

r = f(p) = (R * p) / (P + p)
```

### Roadmap
* Liquidity Pool UI
    * Want to build a cool UI for interacting with the liquidity pool via connected wallet
        * You should be able to see the assets you hold in your connected wallet
        * You should be able to get a preview of what the swap is going to be (amount to recieve)
    * We'll need to make sure we place the code from `tests` - such as the instructions for the program and the token account lookups - in a spot where the code can easily be shared by tests and the UI
    * We'll also want to add some code to "preview swap" so we can use it on the front end, and integrate it into the tests as validation
        * This code should include checks the program will enforce, such as:
            * Amount can't be 0
            * Mints can't match
            * Can't overflow liquidity
            * etc.
* Re-work Day 4 activity flow
    * We're going to have people just interact with the pool instead of trying to write their own
    * Should we just have people use the UI or give them a challenge to write a script to hit the pool?
* Day 4 workshop
    * Build out & prepare the workshop according to the below section

### General Workshop Flow:
* DeFi overview
* DEX's and Constant-Product Algorithm
* SPL tokens and decimal places
* Inspect the program
    * Adding liquidity
    * Swapping
        * Emphasize on CP algorithm (nominal vs. real quantities and K)
* Build & Deploy to localnet
* Run tests
    * Inspect logs
* UI
