In a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), a common way to manage a liquidity pool is through a Constant-Product Algorithm, which involves programmatically ensuring that the product of all assets equals some constant value `K`.

Consider a request to swap `p` number of one asset for some unknown number of another asset `r`:

```
K = a * b * c * d * P * R
K = a * b * c * d * (P + p) * (R - r)

a * b * c * d * P * R = a * b * c * d * (P + p) * (R - r)
PR = (P + p) * (R - r)
PR = PR - Pr + Rp - pr
0 = 0 - Pr + Rp - pr
-Rp = -Pr - pr
-Rp = r(-P - p)
r = (-Rp) / (-P - p)
r = [-1 * Rp] / [-1 * (P + p)]
r = Rp / (P + p)

r = f(p) = (R * p) / (P + p)
```

### To Build:

-   Asset metadata
    -   ‚úÖ We can optionally modify the tests to include the creation of metadata accounts for the corresponding URIs provided in `ASSETS` - ideally in `create-assets.test.ts`
    -   We also want to create a collection on devnet, clone it down to localnet, and make sure these tokens are part of that collection
    -   üí° Perhaps we can use this in the Day 5 with Amman as an extra value-add?
-   Liquidity Pool UI
    -   Want to build a cool UI for interacting with the liquidity pool via connected wallet
        -   You should be able to see the assets you hold in your connected wallet
        -   You should be able to get a preview of what the swap is going to be (amount to recieve)
    -   We'll need to make sure we place the code from `tests` - such as the instructions for the program and the token account lookups - in a spot where the code can easily be shared by tests and the UI
    -   We'll also want to add some code to "preview swap" so we can use it on the front end, and integrate it into the tests as validation
        -   This code should include checks the program will enforce, such as:
            -   Amount can't be 0
            -   Mints can't match
            -   Can't overflow liquidity
            -   etc.
